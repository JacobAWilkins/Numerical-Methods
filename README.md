# Numerical-Methods-to-solve-Linear-System-of-Equations
Finds the least squares solution (x) to a system of equations using Singular Value Decomposition (A=U.sigma.V^t) regardless of A's shape or rank., the normal equations A^t.A.x = A^t.b, x = (A^t.A)^-1.A^t.b, and x=sum_i=0_to_r((u_i^t.b/sigma_i).v_i) where r is the effective rank of A.
